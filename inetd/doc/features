This should become a list of features, from common ones to corner
cases, to help a maintainer see why the code does this or that.

* Use cases

** Enable/disable the superserver

** Enable/disable a service

* Requirements

** Handle xinetd and inetd
Both are in the distro, xinetd default since 8.2, inetd default until
then.
*** If both are installed, let the user choose
*** If none are installed (eg. Minimal+X.sel), let the user add them

** In the main dialog

*** Show also services that are not installed and offer to install them
That was for xinetd. Newly also for inetd, probably not for 9.0.


* Design

** Why iid
If there are two variants of the same service, differing only in
parameters (eg. in.rlogind in inetd.conf), it seemed a good idea to
use the location of the configuration to differentiate.
But in autoyast the user cannot supply the correct iid.
So he cannot enable one of the variants unless the parameters are made
a key field which we don't want.
In xinetd there is only one login service with the alternate parameter
commented out.
