* Keeping an up to date service list

The package contains a list of all services available in the
distribution rpms and their configuration. It is stored in
src/default_conf_{inetd,xinetd}.ycp. (An earlier version of this,
all-services.ycp, is obsolete)

It is necessary to keep the list up to date. It is done by running
all-services.sh. It should be enough to do it later in the beta stage
and then ask the packagers to notify you if there are changes after
that.
